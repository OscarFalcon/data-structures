1) Most of the work is inspired from professor's lectures and notes. (UTSA)

2) I have yet to complete most of the work presented here, so there are probably numerous errors.

3) I studied this material throughout my undergraduate career at UTSA, however all of the code was (initially) 
   written within the period of about a months time as I prepared for an interview.
